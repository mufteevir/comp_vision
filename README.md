[car spikes](https://github.com/mufteevir/comp_vision/tree/master/car%20spikes) is a test project for inspecting spikes for 7 categories: Good, No insert, Chipped insert, turned bush,
No bush, Nofounding bush, Cracking bash for one left camera with original photos. [main.py](https://github.com/mufteevir/comp_vision/blob/master/car%20spikes/main.py) is program for teaching and save model. [test.py](https://github.com/mufteevir/comp_vision/blob/master/car%20spikes/test.py) is program for checking saved model on random files
